To fulfill the requirements of an offline-only code snippet manager built as a static website using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript , we have structured the solution into modular components that align with best practices in architecture, accessibility, and maintainability.

🧠 Core Components
1. StorageManager.ts
Handles all interactions with localStorage, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving snippets.

2. UIManager.ts
Manages rendering and user interaction for the snippet list, form, and code display.

3. ExportManager.ts
Handles exporting a snippet to a downloadable file.

4. SearchManager.ts
Optional utility class for filtering logic (currently handled inline in UIManager for simplicity).

5. Types and Main Entry

Code Snippet Manager
An offline code snippet manager built with TypeScript, HTML, and Prism.js.

Features
Store, tag, search, and retrieve code snippets.
Syntax highlighting using Prism.js.
Export snippets as runnable .py, .js, .html, etc.
Fully offline-capable, uses browser localStorage.

Build
Install TypeScript:
Compile:

Dependencies
Prism.js (download and place in root)
Prism CSS (same)
Future Enhancements
Snippet versioning
Cloud sync (via PWA + Service Workers)
Tag management (rename, delete)
Dark mode
Architecture Decisions
Modular Design : Separated concerns for scalability.
LocalStorage : No external dependencies, ideal for offline use.
Prism.js : Lightweight, supports many languages, and integrates easily.
✅ Accessibility & UX
Semantic HTML (<article>, <section>, <nav>)
ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
Keyboard navigation support
Tabindex and focus styles for interactive elements
This architecture ensures a clean, extensible, and maintainable foundation for future development.
